# Ph.D. Bookmark
A collection of online resources that I found useful for Ph.D. students. Some may be also useful for students who are preparing a Ph.D. application.

## Articles that motivate me
* [The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by Matt Might
* [Applying to Ph.D. Programs in Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)
  * 2.4 Frustrations and joys of research
    * joy of discovering something new
    * joy of truly understanding
    * joy of doing it right
    * joy of being the authority on an area
* [Dear brilliant students: Please consider not doing a PhD.](https://liv.dreamwidth.org/389934.html) by Liv
  * This is a demotivating article instead of a motivating one. You really should have a good reason that justifies why you still want to pursue a Ph.D. degree after all these demerits.

## How to decide the reasearch topics?
* [You and Your Research](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf) by Richard W. Hamming

## Writing Tips
* [How to write a technical paper](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/write-technical-paper.html) by Michael Ernst
* [How to write papers so people can read them](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/talks/talk-plmw16.pdf) by Derek Deyer
