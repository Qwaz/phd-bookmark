# Ph.D. Bookmark
A collection of online resources that I found useful for Ph.D. students. Some may be also useful for students who are preparing a Ph.D. application.

## Articles that motivate me
* [The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by Matt Might
* [Applying to Ph.D. Programs in Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)
  * 2.4 Frustrations and joys of research
    * joy of discovering something new
    * joy of truly understanding
    * joy of doing it right
    * joy of being the authority on an area
* [Dear brilliant students: Please consider not doing a PhD.](https://liv.dreamwidth.org/389934.html) by Liv
  * This is a demotivating article instead of a motivating one. You really should have a good reason that justifies why you still want to pursue a Ph.D. degree after all these demerits.

### Quotes

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - Arthur C. Clarke

> If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants. - Isaac Newton

> We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. - John F. Kennedy
